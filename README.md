## Troubleshooting & Bug reporting

**The issue tracker is for provable issues only:** You will have to make the case that the issue is really with the theme and not something else on your side. To make a case means to provide detailed steps so that anybody can reproduce the issue. Be sure to rule out that the issue is not caused by something specific on your side.

**Required information:**
> 1. Your GTK+ version/theme version/Linux distribution.
> 1. Does the same issue occur with other themes?
> 1. Screenshot. (Use a host that don't require me to enable JavaScript, cookies or browser plugins to be able to view the image.)

**Do not submit support questions to the issue tracker.** Contact me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/eti_f/) or irc `eti0 @ rizon or freenode` for that instead (don't always expect an answer though).  
Public forums and subreddits could provide better support.  
Support questions in the issue tracker will be closed as invalid.
